# SpaceWalkVR Locomotion

I designed an novel locomotion technique, SpaceWalkVR Locomotion, which aims to improve user experience while using VR in lying down posture.

The technique assumes that user is lying down, there is no gravity in VR scene.  

Followings are several functions I designed and implemented.

A. By controlling gravitational sources attached to each controller(L/R), user can move easily and intuitively in VR without excessive bodily movement and sensory conflict.

B.  Enable rope and anchor, constraining character to move around only in certain area. 

C.  Go back to previous location by rewinding rope. 

You can shift your state by long pressing trigger button.
